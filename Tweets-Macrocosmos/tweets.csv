We’ve released a new validator update to improve stability and fairness across the network. If you're running a validator, make sure to update as soon as possible.

Here’s what’s changing 🔽

✅ Max Processing Time Capped at 15s
- Slow hotkeys (e.g. 200s) were skewing speed score normalization
- Any response >15s now gets a speed score of 0
- Speed score normalization now uses the lesser of 15s or the observed max

✅ Unresponsive Hotkeys Penalized
- Previously, some hotkeys stayed active despite being unresponsive for up to 72h
- Now, a timeout = empty response = score penalty

These changes improve the fairness of the scoring system and ensure that only responsive, efficient validators are rewarded. $TAO",webuildscore,4668,611,28,2,0,0,0,0,,

With a deep curiosity sparked by Bitcoin and the 2017 ICO boom, Sam has spent the past decade exploring how blockchain can reshape finance, data, and systems of power. He has worked across various Web3 projects, writing on everything from decentralised finance and money to interoperability and tokenised real-world assets. With a solid grasp of financial systems, macroeconomics, and their intersection with crypto, Sam has a knack for breaking down complex ideas and uncovering their broader societal implications, translating them into clear, accessible narratives for a broad audience.

Combining deep Web3 expertise, sharp storytelling, and a lifelong passion for football, Sam is a natural fit to help shape Score’s voice. He connected immediately with the mission to democratise elite sports data and now plays a key role in articulating Score’s broader vision: building the decentralised computer vision layer for AI, starting with football and expanding far beyond the pitch.

A word from Sam:
 “I’ve come to believe that decentralisation is key to increasing access, enabling scale, and democratising critical systems, whether it’s money, finance, or intelligence. That’s what drew me to Score. As a football fan, I’ve seen how data is transforming the sport, yet access remains locked behind paywalls and elite infrastructure. Score changes that. By decentralising computer vision, it puts powerful tools in the hands of every club, making the game more open, competitive, and dynamic.
But the vision goes far beyond football. Score is building foundational infrastructure to unlock visual intelligence across sports, industries, and entirely new domains. I’m proud to be part of a team that’s not just building cutting-edge technology, but doing it in a way that empowers more people to participate, compete, and innovate.”",webuildscore,4668,611,46,2,3,0,0,0,,

Kacper brings over four years of hands-on experience in Web3, crypto, e-commerce, and AI, working with early-stage startups, high-growth ventures, and established tech teams. Throughout his career, he’s led the growth of social media accounts from 0 to 200k+ followers and managed communities of over 100k members, driving engagement and building loyal user bases across fast-moving, digital-native ecosystems.

From growing his own Web3 projects to helping startups and established projects scale in the crypto and AI space, Kacper witnessed firsthand how attention, trust, and clarity make or break a project. This experience makes him a powerful addition to the Score team as we level up our social and community efforts and bridge the worlds of football, data, and decentralised tech.

A word from Kacper:
""Web3 and AI are full of bold ideas - but not all of them solve real problems.

After years of working in this space, you learn to see past the hype. Score Vision isn’t another dashboard with fancy numbers. It’s a decentralised computer vision framework that tackles one of football’s biggest bottlenecks: access to high-quality analytics.

Football is a global game, but access to advanced analytics has been limited to the top clubs. Score fixes that. This isn’t just a better tool - it’s a paradigm shift. Score allows every club, scout, and analyst to see the game deeper, faster, and smarter.

$DKING Pro Predictions #EuropaLeague

⚽️ Match Outcome Insights
- Tottenham Hotspur has a 36.1% probability to win, with impressive odds of 3.40 on @bet365 offering a +22.7% expected value (EV). 

While Manchester United is favored, this bet is highly appealing for its long-term profitability.

- Manchester United is statistically likely to score, with a 76.45% probability of netting at least one goal.

🤑 Recommended Bets
1. Bet: Tottenham to Win
- Odds: 3.40 (implied probability: 29.4%)
- Expected Value (EV): +22.7%

💡 This is the highest-value bet for this game due to odds being significantly more favorable compared to their actual win probability. Note that lower probabilities mean higher variance, so manage risks.

2. Bet: Both Teams to Score – Yes
- Odds: 1.75 (implied probability: 57.1%)
- Expected Value (EV): +14.7%

💡 Given Manchester United's high likelihood of scoring, this offers additional value. It aligns with the attacking trends expected for both sides.

📊 Key Factors Influencing the Match
1. Goals & Corners Predictions:
- A high-probability match for intense play, with over 5 corners almost guaranteed (94.17%).

- The match may trend towards fewer than 3.5 goals, with a 55.29% probability of under 3.5 total goals.

2. Manchester United's Edge:
- A strong likelihood of scoring at least one goal, but scoring over three goals remains unlikely (**10.01% probability**).

3. Tottenham's Underdog Appeal:

- Despite lower implied probabilities, Tottenham's odds reflect a strong opportunity for value betting.

🧠 Strategy Recommendations
- Primary Target: ""Tottenham to Win"" for high EV (+22.7%).

- Secondary Focus: ""Both Teams to Score – Yes"" offers substantial value with safer probability margins.

- Monitor Markets: Keep an eye on odds movement closer to kickoff for potential changes in value opportunities.

Starting with sports, where 90-minute football matches can be processed and labeled in under 3 seconds, the model scales across industries.

""We first met the Score team at TOKEN2049 in Dubai, and it quickly became clear they weren't just building another AI tool. They've got a sharp product, a tight vision, and a real plan to turn Subnet 44 into a commercial powerhouse,"" said DSV.

As Subnet 44 opens up to other verticals, it provides the infrastructure layer to become the optic nerve for AI, supporting the development of human-level AI and beyond.

""Siam and Mark bring exactly the kind of strategic thinking we need as we scale Score,"" said Nigel Grant  co-founder and Score's CSO. ""They understand the Bittensor ecosystem deeply and share our long-term vision for what decentralized AI can achieve. This partnership gives us the strategic support to navigate the complexities of building on $TAO while staying focused on our mission.""

The partnership reflects DSV's visionary approach under @SiamKidd and @markcreaser's leadership, plus their understanding of navigating the $TAO & dTAO ecosystem, both the challenges and opportunities. 

This represents a bridge between aligned entities committed to the long-term, positive-sum game that $TAO's core values represent.

Looking ahead, Score is expanding beyond Subnet 44 as we train our Object Value Function model across other subnets and prepare to introduce new tasks to our miners pool. 

This growth reflects our commitment to building infrastructure that serves the entire Bittensor ecosystem.

You can hear more about this vision when our CEO Maxime (@mxmsbt) speaks at @proofoftalk in Paris on panels next month about owning subnets and collective intelligence.

Two topics at the heart of what we're building together with partners like DSV.",webuildscore,4668,611,150,23,10,0,0,0,,

- Model Probability: 46.3%
- Expected Value (EV): +114.74% 🚀
- Why? Real Betis has a significant edge, with odds underestimating their chances, providing exceptional betting value.

2. Over 1.5 Goals:

- Odds: 1.81 (Unibet)
- Model Probability: 78.09%
- Expected Value (EV): +4.27%
- A smaller yet consistent value. The game's attacking profile supports this bet.

💡 Supplementary Bet: Over 1.5 Goals at 1.81. Good choice for more cautious bettors.

Final Note
Monitor team announcements and market odds leading up to the match. Large discrepancies, especially on Betis' win odds, hint at possible market inefficiencies.

Base Leg: Double Chance (Draw or Inter to Win)

Odds: 1.87 (bet365)
Implied Probability: 53.48%
Rationale: This introduces a safe market under your requested condition, leveraging the tight match probabilities (Draw: 23.53%, Inter Win: 28.64%) for a total of 52.17% modeled probability, comparing favorably to bookmaker evaluation.

Correlated Leg: Over 2.5 Goals

Odds: 2.10 (10Bet)
Implied Probability: 47.62%
Model Probability: 60.66%
Expected Value: +7.84% ✅
Rationale: Goals are expected to flow in this high-tempo final, with Inter employing a counter-attacking style and PSG’s offense pushing for a decisive result.

📊 SGP Breakdown

Combined Odds: Approximately 3.93

Statistical Correlation: Matches with high goal expectations often involve an underdog’s push for offensive results, supporting the Draw/Inter scenario while maintaining synergy with Over 2.5 Goals.

Risk Control: Both legs are statistically well-aligned and avoid overlap risk.

📌 Optional Third Leg (Increased Payout)

Leg: Over 6 Corners

Odds: 1.30 (Widely Available)
Implied Probability: 76.92%
Model Probability: 78.27%
Rationale: High-paced finals often result in multiple set pieces (corners). Adding this leg increases the parlay’s payout while keeping risk moderate.

- Maps where danger starts
- Highlights tactical launch zones
- Reveals buildup fingerprints
- Helps analysts and scouts see the system behind the stats",webuildscore,4677,612,0,0,0,1,0,0,1816264150755979264,webuildscore

 It doesn’t see:
 – Off-ball runs
 – Positional rotations
 – What happens after the ball hits a danger zone

And it rewards completed actions, even sloppy ones.

Use it with context.",webuildscore,4677,612,0,0,0,1,0,0,1816264150755979264,webuildscore

Think:
- Rodri threading a vertical ball
- Vinícius breaking lines off the dribble
- Doku dragging defenders with chaos runs

Even without a shot or assist, threat was created.",webuildscore,4677,612,0,0,0,1,0,0,1816264150755979264,webuildscore
